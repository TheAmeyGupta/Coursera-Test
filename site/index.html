	<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
	<p>I am currently a freshman at BITS Pilani pursuing a B.E(Hons.) in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. I was born and brought up in Delhi and spent my entire life there untill moving to college.</p>
	<p>Electronics and Computer Science are two fields which really interest me. I am hoping to learn more about them and build some cool projects. I used to be a speedcuber in middleschool and am currently trying my hands on Competitive Programming.

	<h2>What is this Website?</h2>
	<p>Well, this is just me learning HTML and CSS and trying to make something out of it.</p>
